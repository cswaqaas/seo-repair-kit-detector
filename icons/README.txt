ICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To create the required icon files:

1. Open "create-icons.html" in your browser (in the parent directory)
2. Click the "Generate Icons" button
3. Right-click on each canvas and select "Save image as..."
4. Save them with these exact names:
   - icon16.png (16x16 size)
   - icon48.png (48x48 size)
   - icon128.png (128x128 size)

The extension will work without icons (Chrome will use a default icon), but it's recommended to add custom icons for a better user experience.
